These data were sourced by the literature (Wu X.Z., Liu H., Wang R.K. Determination of geometric reliability index of piles at site-specific scale: case studies. Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Geotechnical Engineering, 2023, 176(2):118-131.) https://doi.org/10.1680/jgeen.20.00204 The qpss file can be opened by any text editor, such as notepad or editplus.
